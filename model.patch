+      • GET /api/scans/stats/summary - Statistics endpoint working perfectly
+      
+      🔍 TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
+      • MongoDB connection and data persistence confirmed
+      • Error handling (400/404) working correctly for invalid requests
+      • JSON serialization with ObjectId conversion working properly
+      • CORS middleware allowing cross-origin requests
+      • All endpoints accessible via production URL: https://acne-tracker-2.preview.emergentagent.com/api
+      
+      📊 DATABASE STATUS: 1 scan remaining in MongoDB after testing cleanup
+      
+      🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION: Backend API is fully functional and ready for frontend integration.
